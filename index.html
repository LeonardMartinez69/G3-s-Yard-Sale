                        <p class="text">   Welcome to G3 Garage Sale! At Adamson University, Computer Science students Miles Baldres, Freidrich Fajardo, Ledmor Martija, Princess Miraflores, and James Radan launched the campus’s first-ever garage sale. What began as a simple idea to declutter their rooms and give new life to unused items quickly grew into a vibrant community event—with a meaningful purpose. Beyond offering budget-friendly finds, G3 Garage Sale is driven by a commitment to support charitable initiatives, turning everyday items into opportunities to help others.
